# PimoroniPicoInkyPackParking

We live in a city area with very limited street parking, and since we don't use our car every day, we always forget, where it is parked. I wrote a 
@pimoroni Pico Inky Pack (Inky Park? ðŸ˜€) Python app to solve that! (that is, if wifey remembers to update the app ðŸ˜›)

With the app you can set:
* Street
* Streetnumber

The code is in English with some Danish variables/lead texts throw in:
* gade = street
* tiere = tens
* enere = ones
* slut = finish

The program logic was inspired by the [Pimoroni clock example](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/examples/pico_inky/clock.py) written by [@Gadgetoid](https://github.com/Gadgetoid)
